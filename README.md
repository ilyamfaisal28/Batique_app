# Batique
Batique is an android app to classify images of six Batik classes from Northern Coastal Region of Java Island. This project was built for my undergraduate thesis research.<br>

In this research, the CNN method will be applied with the ResNet50V2, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19 architectures, comparing these three models and integrating them into an Android-based application for automating batik motif classification. 

Additionally, this study will employ a dataset of batik motifs from the Northern Coastal Region of Java Island and apply data augmentation techniques to improve the models' ability to recognize diverse batik motifs. The dataset comprises a total of seven classes, six of which represent batik motifs from the Northern Coastal Region of Java Island, and one serves as a negative class.
